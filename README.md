2 Player Battleship
Using a two-dimensional List, create a battleship game board (minimum space size of 20x20) for each player. 
Allow the player to place a destroyer (space size: 2), submarine (space size: 3), 2 battleship (space size: 4, and aircraft carrier (space size: 5) on the game board. Check to make sure that they do not overlap. 
Ensure that each player can place their ships on the game board and that the ship locations will be hidden from the other player. (You can assume that each player will move away from the screen when it is not their turn). 
On each player turn they should be presented with a console print out of the other player’s board as they know it. (Ships and parts of ships that haven’t been hit should be hidden, misses should be displayed. Each player should also be able to view their own board with updated hits and misses).
The game should keep track of which ships have been completely destroyed. This is a way to keep score.
